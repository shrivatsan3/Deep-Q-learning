# Deep-Q-learning
Julia implementation of the Deep Q learning algorithm to solve the mountain car problem. I define an episode as stepping through the environment until you reach a terminal state, or the discount goes lower than 0.005. I define an epoch as running n episodes and one training session over all sampled data (n can be set in code).
